## **Project Overview**  
The **Diamond Price Prediction** project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to **accurately estimate the price of diamonds** based on their **physical and qualitative characteristics**. Diamonds are valued based on various attributes, including **carat weight**, **cut quality**, **color**, and **clarity** — often referred to as the **4Cs of Diamonds**. By analyzing these features alongside dimensions like **depth**, **table width**, and **size**, the model can identify key factors that influence pricing and predict the value of unseen diamonds.  

This project provides valuable insights for **buyers**, **sellers**, and **jewelers**, helping them make informed decisions in a highly competitive market.

## **Data Dictionary**  
The dataset includes **10 key features** essential for predicting diamond prices:  

| **Column Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **carat**        | Weight of the diamond (primary factor influencing price) |
| **cut**          | Quality of the diamond's cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) |
| **color**        | Diamond color, ranked from **J (worst)** to **D (best)** |
| **clarity**      | Diamond clarity, indicating imperfections (**I1 (worst)** to **IF (best)**) |
| **x**            | Length of the diamond in millimeters (mm) |
| **y**            | Width of the diamond in millimeters (mm) |
| **z**            | Depth of the diamond in millimeters (mm) |
| **depth**        | Total depth percentage = \( \frac{z}{\text{mean}(x, y)} \) |
| **table**        | Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point |
| **price**        | Price in **US dollars** (ranging from **$326 to $18,823**) |

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Key Insights**  
In-depth EDA revealed several crucial insights into the factors affecting diamond prices:  

### **1. Carat Weight as the Strongest Predictor:**  
- A **positive linear relationship** exists between carat weight and price — **heavier diamonds command higher prices**.  
- However, price increases **exponentially** for larger diamonds, indicating rarity value.  

### **2. Cut Quality & Its Influence on Price:**  
- Diamonds with a **Premium** or **Ideal** cut are significantly more expensive than those with **Fair** or **Good** cuts.  
- Cut quality impacts brilliance, which plays a crucial role in valuation.  

### **3. Color and Clarity Impact:**  
- Diamonds with better color grades (**D to F**) are priced higher.  
- **Clarity** has a more significant impact on **smaller carat** diamonds, where imperfections are more visible.  

### **4. Dimensional Influence:**  
- **Depth** and **table width** significantly impact brilliance and, consequently, price.  
- Optimal depth (60–63%) and table percentage (53–57%) align with higher valuation.

## **Machine Learning Models — Building & Evaluation**  
Multiple regression models were tested to predict diamond prices, including:  

- **Linear Regression**: Performed well for smaller diamonds but struggled with outliers.  
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Captured non-linear relationships but prone to overfitting.  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Delivered robust performance by averaging multiple decision trees.  
- **XGBoost Regressor**: Handled complex relationships efficiently, outperforming other models.  

### **Model Performance:**  

| **Model**               | **R² Score (Accuracy)** |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**    | 88.56% |
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | 91.23% |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | 94.67% |
| **XGBoost Regressor** | **96.12%** |

✅ **XGBoost Regressor** emerged as the most accurate model, offering reliable predictions even for high-priced diamonds.
