## **Project Overview**  
The **Delhi House Price Prediction** project aims to accurately estimate house prices across various localities in **Delhi**, one of India's most dynamic real estate markets. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project provides valuable insights into the key factors influencing house prices, such as **area**, **number of bedrooms**, **locality**, and **property type**. The predictions generated by this model can guide potential buyers in making informed decisions while assisting sellers in setting competitive prices.  

The dataset, sourced from **Kaggle**, comprises **1259 rows** and **11 columns**, each capturing vital attributes that significantly impact house pricing.

## **Data Dictionary**  
The dataset includes the following key features:  

| **Column Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Area**         | Total area of the house in square feet |
| **BHK**          | Number of bedrooms |
| **Bathroom**     | Number of bathrooms |
| **Furnishing**   | Furnishing status (Furnished, Semi-Furnished, or Unfurnished) |
| **Locality**     | Geographic location of the property |
| **Parking**      | Number of parking spaces available |
| **Price**        | Total price of the house in INR (Target Variable) |
| **Status**       | Property status (Ready to move or Under Construction) |
| **Transaction**  | Transaction type (New Property or Resale) |
| **Type**         | Type of property (Builder Floor, Apartment, etc.) |
| **Per_Sqft**     | Price per square foot |

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Key Insights**  
In-depth EDA uncovered several significant insights into Delhi's real estate market:  

### **1. Factors Influencing House Prices:**  
- **Area:** Larger houses tend to have significantly higher prices.  
- **Number of Bedrooms (BHK):** Properties with more bedrooms command higher prices.  
- **Locality:**  
  - **Punjabi Bagh**, **Lajpat Nagar**, and **Vasant Kunj** stand out as high-end areas with elevated property prices.  
  - Outer localities exhibit comparatively lower property prices.  
- **Property Type:**  
  - Builder floors are preferred for customization, while apartments are more common in urban areas.  
- **Furnishing:**  
  - Fully furnished houses generally have a higher price per square foot.  

### **2. Market Trends and Preferences:**  
- **Ready-to-move** properties are in higher demand compared to under-construction properties.  
- **New Builder Floors** reflect a growing preference for independence and modern architecture.  
- **High Parking Availability** correlates with increased property value, especially in congested urban areas.

## **Machine Learning Models — Building & Evaluation**  
To predict house prices, multiple regression models were developed and evaluated:  

- **Decision Tree Regressor:**  
  - Provided interpretability but struggled with overfitting.  
- **Random Forest Regressor:**  
  - Achieved superior performance by aggregating multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting, and capturing complex relationships.  

### **Model Performance:**  

| **Model**              | **R² Score (Accuracy)** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | 78.56% |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | **84.98%** |

✅ The **Random Forest Regressor** outperformed other models, making it the ideal choice for this prediction task.
