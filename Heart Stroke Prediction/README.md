# **Stroke Prediction**  
![Stroke Prediction](https://dezyre.gumlet.io/images/blog/heart-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning-project/Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.png?w=330&dpr=2.6)  

## üìå **Project Overview**  
Stroke is one of the **leading causes of death and disability** worldwide, accounting for approximately **11%** of global deaths, according to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. Early detection of individuals at risk of stroke is crucial for enabling timely **preventive measures** and **medical interventions**.  

The **Stroke Prediction** project leverages **machine learning techniques** to build a predictive model that identifies individuals at risk of stroke based on **demographic**, **lifestyle**, and **health-related** attributes. By analyzing factors such as **age**, **hypertension**, **heart disease**, **BMI**, and **smoking status**, this model can assist healthcare professionals in **early diagnosis**, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## üìä **Dataset Information**  
The dataset contains **12 key attributes**, each representing critical information about a patient's health and lifestyle. Each row corresponds to a unique patient record.  

| **Column Name**        | **Description**                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **id**                  | Unique identifier for each patient                  |
| **gender**              | Gender of the patient: **Male**, **Female**, or **Other** |
| **age**                 | Age of the patient in years                         |
| **hypertension**        | 0 if no hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension |
| **heart_disease**       | 0 if no heart disease, 1 if the patient has heart disease |
| **ever_married**        | Marital status: **Yes** or **No**                   |
| **work_type**           | Employment type: **Children**, **Govt_job**, **Private**, **Self-employed**, or **Never_worked** |
| **Residence_type**      | Type of residence: **Urban** or **Rural**           |
| **avg_glucose_level**   | Average glucose level in the blood                  |
| **bmi**                 | Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient                |
| **smoking_status**      | **Formerly smoked**, **Never smoked**, **Smokes**, or **Unknown** |
| **stroke**              | **Target Variable:** 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not |

## üîç **Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

- **Age** is the most influential factor ‚Äî individuals aged **60 and above** have a significantly higher risk.  
- **Hypertension** and **heart disease** dramatically increase stroke risk.  
- **Smoking Status:**  
  - Smokers and former smokers are more prone to strokes compared to non-smokers.  
- **Glucose Levels:**  
  - High **average glucose levels** are associated with a greater likelihood of stroke.  
- **Employment Type:**  
  - Individuals in **private sector** jobs showed a slightly higher stroke rate.  
- **Residence:**  
  - Urban residents have a marginally higher stroke incidence compared to rural residents.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Machine Learning Models ‚Äî Development & Performance**  
Multiple classification models were developed and evaluated to predict stroke risk:  

| **Model**                | **Accuracy**        | **Precision**    | **Recall**         | **F1-Score**     |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**    | 79%                | 80%              | 76%                | 78%              |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | 81%                | 82%              | 79%                | 80%              |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | **85%**            | **86%**          | **84%**            | **85%**          |
| **XGBoost Classifier**     | 84%                | 85%              | 83%                | 84%              |

‚úÖ The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the **highest accuracy (85%)**, handling non-linear relationships effectively while minimizing overfitting.
