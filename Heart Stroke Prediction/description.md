## **Project Overview**  
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, it accounts for approximately **11% of total deaths globally**. Early detection of stroke risk can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention.  

This **Stroke Prediction** project leverages **machine learning** techniques to build a predictive model that identifies individuals at **high risk of stroke** based on demographic, lifestyle, and health-related attributes. By analyzing factors such as **age**, **hypertension**, **heart disease**, **BMI**, and **smoking status**, this project provides valuable insights to **healthcare providers** and **patients**, facilitating early preventive measures.

## üìä **Dataset Information**  
The dataset includes **12 key attributes**, each representing critical information about a patient's health and lifestyle. Each row corresponds to a unique patient record.  

| **Column Name**       | **Description**                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **id**                 | Unique identifier for each patient                   |
| **gender**             | Gender of the patient: **Male**, **Female**, or **Other** |
| **age**                | Age of the patient in years                          |
| **hypertension**       | 0 if no hypertension, 1 if patient has hypertension  |
| **heart_disease**      | 0 if no heart disease, 1 if patient has heart disease |
| **ever_married**       | Marital status: **Yes** or **No**                     |
| **work_type**          | Employment type: **Children**, **Govt_job**, **Private**, **Self-employed**, or **Never_worked** |
| **Residence_type**     | Type of residence: **Urban** or **Rural**            |
| **avg_glucose_level**  | Average glucose level in the blood                   |
| **bmi**                | Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient                 |
| **smoking_status**     | **Formerly smoked**, **Never smoked**, **Smokes**, or **Unknown** |
| **stroke**             | **Target Variable:** 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not |

## üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äî Key Insights**  
The EDA process provided several important insights into the factors contributing to stroke risk:  

### **1. Age and Stroke Risk:**  
- **Age** is the most significant predictor. Patients over **60 years old** exhibited a substantially higher stroke rate.  
- Younger individuals had a lower likelihood but were not entirely risk-free.  

### **2. Impact of Health Conditions:**  
- **Hypertension** and **heart disease** significantly increased stroke risk.  
- Patients with both conditions showed the highest probability of experiencing a stroke.  

### **3. Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors:**  
- **Smoking Status:**  
  - Active smokers and those who formerly smoked were more prone to strokes than non-smokers.  
- **Glucose Levels:**  
  - Patients with high **average glucose levels** (hyperglycemia) were at greater risk.  

### **4. Socioeconomic and Demographic Insights:**  
- **Work Type:**  
  - People in **private sector jobs** had a slightly higher stroke rate than government employees or self-employed individuals.  
- **Residence Type:**  
  - Urban residents reported marginally higher stroke incidences compared to rural residents, possibly due to lifestyle factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Machine Learning Models ‚Äî Development & Performance**  
Multiple classification models were developed and evaluated for stroke prediction:  

| **Model**                | **Accuracy**        | **Precision**    | **Recall**         | **F1-Score**     |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**    | 79%                | 80%              | 76%                | 78%              |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | 81%                | 82%              | 79%                | 80%              |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | **85%**            | **86%**          | **84%**            | **85%**          |
| **XGBoost Classifier**     | 84%                | 85%              | 83%                | 84%              |

‚úÖ The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the **highest accuracy (85%)**, effectively handling non-linear relationships and reducing overfitting.
