![Hotel Reservation](https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/474/062/original/hotel-reservation-conceptual-illustration-design-vector.jpg)  

## üìå **Project Overview**  
The **Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction** project aims to address one of the most pressing challenges in the **hospitality industry** ‚Äî **reservation cancellations**. With the increasing prevalence of **online booking platforms** and **flexible cancellation policies**, hotels face significant revenue losses due to last-minute cancellations.  

This project utilizes **machine learning** techniques to predict whether a reservation is likely to be canceled based on factors such as:  
- **Guest composition**  
- **Lead time**  
- **Booking timing**  
- **Market segment**  
- **Special requests**  

By identifying high-risk reservations, hotel management can implement proactive policies to **optimize occupancy**, **minimize revenue loss**, and **enhance customer satisfaction**.

## üîç **Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Exploratory data analysis revealed several significant insights:  

### **1. Guest Composition:**  
- Reservations for **2 adults with no children** had the **highest cancellation rate**, indicating a trend among couples.  
- **Family bookings** with children had a lower cancellation rate.  

### **2. Booking Timing:**  
- **Weekday bookings** showed significantly **higher cancellations** compared to weekend bookings.  
- **Lead time** strongly influenced cancellations ‚Äî longer lead times correlated with higher cancellation rates.  

### **3. Year and Month Trends:**  
- The year **2018** recorded a higher cancellation rate than **2017**.  
- **July** and **October** had the most cancellations, indicating seasonal patterns.  

### **4. Market Segment:**  
- **Online platforms** accounted for the most cancellations, emphasizing the need for **online reputation management**.  
- **Offline bookings** showed higher commitment rates.  

### **5. Special Requests and Services:**  
- **Number of special requests** had a slight inverse relationship with cancellations.  
- **Meal type** and **car parking space** showed minimal impact.
