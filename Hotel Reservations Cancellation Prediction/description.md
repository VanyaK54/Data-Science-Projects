# **Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction**  
![](https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/474/062/original/hotel-reservation-conceptual-illustration-design-vector.jpg)  

## **Project Overview**  
In the highly competitive **hospitality industry**, reservation cancellations pose a significant challenge for hotel management. **Online booking platforms** have transformed how customers reserve rooms, but the convenience of **low-cost** or **free cancellations** often leads to a high rate of **last-minute cancellations**, causing substantial **revenue loss** for hotels.  

The **Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction** project aims to leverage **machine learning** to predict whether a booking is likely to be canceled based on various factors such as **guest composition**, **booking timing**, **market segment**, **lead time**, and **special requests**. By identifying high-risk reservations, hotels can implement proactive strategies to **minimize cancellations** and **maximize revenue**.

## üîç **Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

### **1. Guest Composition:**  
- **Couple bookings** (2 adults, no children) had the **highest cancellation rates**.  
- **Family bookings** with children had a comparatively **lower cancellation rate**.  

### **2. Booking Timing:**  
- **Weekday bookings** had significantly **higher cancellation rates** than weekend bookings.  
- **Lead time** played a crucial role ‚Äî longer lead times led to more cancellations.  

### **3. Temporal Trends:**  
- The year **2018** experienced a higher cancellation rate compared to **2017**.  
- **July** and **October** recorded the most cancellations, indicating potential seasonal effects.  

### **4. Market Segment:**  
- **Online booking platforms** accounted for the majority of cancellations, emphasizing the importance of the hotel's **online reputation**.  
- **Offline bookings** had a relatively higher commitment rate.  

### **5. Services and Special Requests:**  
- Contrary to expectations, **meal type**, **parking space requirement**, and **special requests** had minimal impact on cancellations.

## üèóÔ∏è **Machine Learning Models ‚Äî Development & Performance**  
To predict reservation cancellations, several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:  

| **Model**                | **Accuracy**        | **Precision**    | **Recall**         | **F1-Score**     |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**    | 80%                | 81%              | 78%                | 79%              |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | **85%**            | **86%**          | **84%**            | **85%**          |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | 83%                | 84%              | 81%                | 82%              |
| **XGBoost Classifier**     | 84%                | 85%              | 83%                | 84%              |

‚úÖ The **Decision Tree Classifier** achieved the **highest accuracy (85%)**, balancing simplicity and predictive power.
