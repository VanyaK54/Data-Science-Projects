![E-Commerce Delivery](https://globalskylogistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/THE-CHANGING-NATURE-OF-E-COMMERCE-DELIVERY.jpg)  

## üìå **Project Overview**  
The **E-Commerce Product Delivery Prediction** project aims to **predict whether products will be delivered on time** for an international e-commerce company. By analyzing key factors such as **shipment mode**, **warehouse location**, **product importance**, **customer behavior**, and **product attributes**, this project offers valuable insights to help **reduce delays** and **enhance customer satisfaction**.  

The company primarily deals in **electronic products**, where timely delivery is crucial for **maintaining business reputation** and **customer loyalty**. The project leverages **machine learning techniques** to build a predictive model that assists in **logistics optimization** and **customer retention strategies**.

## üìä **Dataset Information**  
The dataset contains **10,999 records** with **12 variables**, including shipment details, customer behavior, and product features.  

| **Column Name**          | **Description**                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **ID**                   | Unique customer identifier                           |
| **Warehouse_block**      | Warehouse location (A, B, C, D, E)                   |
| **Mode_of_Shipment**     | Mode of shipment (Ship, Flight, Road)                |
| **Customer_care_calls**  | Number of calls made regarding shipment inquiries    |
| **Customer_rating**      | Customer satisfaction rating (1 to 5)                |
| **Cost_of_the_Product**  | Product cost in US Dollars                           |
| **Prior_purchases**      | Number of prior purchases made by the customer       |
| **Product_importance**   | Product importance (Low, Medium, High)               |
| **Gender**               | Gender of the customer (Male/Female)                 |
| **Discount_offered**     | Discount percentage on the product                   |
| **Weight_in_gms**        | Weight of the product in grams                       |
| **Reached.on.Time_Y.N**  | **Target Variable:** 1 - Delayed, 0 - On Time        |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Workflow**  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values and ensured correct data types.  
   - Outlier detection and removal for weight and discount variables.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed the impact of weight, cost, and shipment mode on delivery times.  
   - Visualized customer behavior patterns and warehouse efficiency.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created new features (e.g., shipment efficiency ratio).  
   - Scaled numerical features for better model performance.  

4. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested multiple classification models:
     - **Decision Tree Classifier**
     - **Random Forest Classifier**
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Assessed performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.  
   - Decision Tree Classifier achieved the highest accuracy (**69%**).

## üìà **Key Insights from EDA**  

- **Product Characteristics:**  
  - Products weighing **2500‚Äì3500 grams** had better on-time delivery rates.  
  - Lower-cost products (below **$250**) showed higher punctuality.  

- **Shipment Analysis:**  
  - **Shipments via Flight** had the fastest delivery times.  
  - **Road shipments** faced the highest frequency of delays.  

- **Customer Behavior:**  
  - Higher customer inquiry calls correlated with delayed deliveries.  
  - Loyal customers with more prior purchases experienced more on-time deliveries.  

- **Discount Patterns:**  
  - Products with **0‚Äì10%** discounts were more likely to be delivered late.  
  - Higher discounts (**>10%**) improved delivery punctuality.

## üîç **Model Performance**  

| **Model**                | **Accuracy**        |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | **69%** |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | 68% |
| **Logistic Regression**     | 67% |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | 65% |

‚úÖ The **Decision Tree Classifier** demonstrated the best performance, balancing simplicity and predictive power.
