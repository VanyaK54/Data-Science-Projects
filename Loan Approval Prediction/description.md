# **Loan Approval Prediction Project**  
![Loan Approval](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*UC0sy0bENl-DLPy3jmXNag.jpeg)  

##  **Project Overview**  
The **Loan Approval Prediction** project leverages **data analytics** and **machine learning** to predict whether a loan application will be approved by a bank. Loan approval decisions depend on a variety of factors, including:  
- **Applicant's income and employment status**  
- **Creditworthiness (CIBIL score)**  
- **Loan amount and tenure**  
- **Asset values (residential, commercial, luxury)**  
- **Number of dependents**  

By analyzing these variables, the project seeks to develop a predictive model that can identify **high-potential applicants**, streamline the loan approval process, and improve **risk management**. This project is essential for banks aiming to **prioritize customers**, **reduce loan processing time**, and **minimize the risk of defaults**.

## üéØ **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model that:  

- **Accurately predicts loan approval** based on applicant data.  
- **Identifies key factors** influencing loan approvals.  
- **Streamlines the loan application process**, reducing processing time.  
- **Enhances risk management**, minimizing loan default risks.

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Workflow**  

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., **education**, **self_employed**).  
   - Normalized and scaled numerical variables to improve model performance.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed the impact of income, loan amount, and asset values on loan approval.  
   - Explored the role of **CIBIL score** in risk mitigation.  
   - Visualized patterns and trends using histograms and heatmaps.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created new features such as **debt-to-income ratio** and **asset-to-liability ratio**.  
   - Selected the most influential features to improve model efficiency.  

4. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested several classification models:  
     - **Logistic Regression** ‚Äî Establishing a baseline performance.  
     - **Decision Tree Classifier** ‚Äî Interpretable decision-making.  
     - **Random Forest Classifier** ‚Äî Handling non-linear relationships.  
     - **XGBoost Classifier** ‚Äî Optimizing performance on large datasets.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated models using key metrics:  
     - **Accuracy** ‚Äî Overall performance of the model.  
     - **Precision** ‚Äî Correctness of positive predictions.  
     - **Recall** ‚Äî Ability to detect approved loans.  
     - **F1-Score** ‚Äî Harmonic mean of precision and recall.  
   - Cross-validation to ensure generalization on unseen data.

## üìà **Model Performance**  

| **Model**                | **Accuracy**        | **Precision**    | **Recall**         | **F1-Score**     |
|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**    | 81%                | 80%              | 78%                | 79%              |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | 83%                | 82%              | 81%                | 82%              |

## üîç **Key Insights from EDA**  

1. **Impact of Income and Loan Amount:**  
   - Higher income applicants had a better chance of loan approval.  
   - Applicants requesting **lower loan amounts** were more likely to be approved.  

2. **CIBIL Score Significance:**  
   - **CIBIL score >750** significantly improved loan approval chances.  
   - Scores below 600 had a high rejection rate.  

3. **Asset Value and Loan Outcome:**  
   - Higher **residential and commercial asset values** correlated with approval.  
   - **Luxury assets** had minimal impact compared to income and credit score.  

4. **Self-Employment vs. Salaried Applicants:**  
   - Salaried applicants had a higher loan approval rate than self-employed individuals.  
   - Self-employed applicants faced more scrutiny due to income variability.  

5. **Loan Tenure:**  
   - **Shorter loan tenures (5 years or less)** increased the probability of approval.  
   - Longer tenures correlated with higher rejection rates due to repayment risk.
