![Loan Approval](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*UC0sy0bENl-DLPy3jmXNag.jpeg)  

## üìå **Project Overview**  
The **Loan Approval Prediction** project aims to leverage **machine learning** to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected by a bank. Loan approvals are influenced by multiple factors such as:  

- **Applicant's annual income and employment status**  
- **Loan amount and tenure**  
- **Creditworthiness (CIBIL score)**  
- **Asset values (residential, commercial, and luxury)**  
- **Number of dependents**  

By analyzing these factors, this project seeks to streamline the loan approval process, helping banks prioritize high-potential applicants while minimizing **loan default risks**. The predictive model developed in this project enhances **risk assessment**, **customer service**, and **decision-making efficiency**.

## üéØ **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can:  

- **Accurately forecast loan approval outcomes** based on applicant data.  
- **Highlight key factors** that significantly influence loan approval.  
- **Reduce processing time** by prioritizing high-potential applications.  
- **Support risk management**, lowering default rates.

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Workflow**  

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., **education**, **self_employed**).  
   - Scaled numerical features to standardize the dataset.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identified key factors such as **CIBIL score**, **income**, and **loan amount**.  
   - Analyzed the impact of **assets** and **employment status** on loan approval.  
   - Visualized patterns using bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created derived features like **debt-to-income ratio** and **asset-to-liability ratio**.  
   - Selected relevant features to improve model performance.  

4. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested multiple classification models:  
     - **Logistic Regression** ‚Äî Baseline model for binary classification.  
     - **Decision Tree Classifier** ‚Äî Useful for interpretability.  
     - **Random Forest Classifier** ‚Äî Handles non-linear relationships well.  
     - **XGBoost Classifier** ‚Äî Optimized for high-performance classification.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated performance using metrics such as:  
     - **Accuracy** ‚Äî Overall performance.  
     - **Precision** ‚Äî Correctness of positive predictions.  
     - **Recall** ‚Äî Ability to detect approved loans.  
     - **F1-Score** ‚Äî Balances precision and recall.  
   - Cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting.

## üìà **Model Performance**  

| **Model**                | **Accuracy** | **Precision** | **Recall** | **F1-Score** |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression**    | 81%         | 80%          | 78%       | 79%         |
| **Decision Tree Classifier** | 83%        | 82%          | 81%       | 82%         |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | **86%**    | **85%**      | **84%**   | **85%**     |
| **XGBoost Classifier**     | 85%         | 85%          | 83%       | 84%         |

‚úÖ The **Random Forest Classifier** outperformed other models with an **accuracy of 86%**, making it the most reliable choice for loan approval prediction.

## üîç **Key Insights from EDA**  

1. **Income & Loan Amount Relationship:**  
   - Higher **annual income** increased the likelihood of loan approval.  
   - **Lower loan amounts** had a better approval rate due to reduced repayment risk.  

2. **CIBIL Score Significance:**  
   - **CIBIL score >750** was strongly associated with loan approval.  
   - Applicants with scores below **600** faced a high rejection rate.  

3. **Asset Value Impact:**  
   - **Residential and commercial assets** positively influenced loan approval.  
   - **Luxury asset values** had minimal impact.  

4. **Employment Type:**  
   - Salaried individuals had a higher approval rate compared to **self-employed** applicants.  
   - Self-employed applicants had stricter scrutiny due to income inconsistency.  

5. **Loan Tenure:**  
   - **Shorter tenures (‚â§ 5 years)** correlated with higher approval rates.  
   - **Longer tenures** posed a greater repayment risk.
