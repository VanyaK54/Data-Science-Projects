## üìå **Project Overview**  
The **House Price Prediction** project aims to leverage **machine learning** techniques to accurately estimate the sale prices of residential properties. The real estate market is influenced by numerous factors, including **location**, **property size**, **number of bedrooms and bathrooms**, **neighborhood characteristics**, and **market trends**. By analyzing historical housing data, this project seeks to uncover meaningful insights and build a predictive model capable of forecasting house prices.  

Accurate house price prediction is essential for:  
- **Homebuyers** to assess fair market value.  
- **Sellers** to set competitive asking prices.  
- **Real estate agents** to provide better client guidance.  
- **Investors** to identify profitable opportunities.

## üéØ **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to build a **robust machine learning model** capable of accurately predicting house prices. By leveraging historical data and identifying key factors influencing house values, the project aims to:  

- **Assist buyers** in making informed investment decisions.  
- **Help sellers** set competitive prices.  
- **Support real estate agents** in guiding clients.  
- **Enable investors** to spot profitable opportunities.

## üèóÔ∏è **Approach**  
The project follows a systematic process to ensure high predictive performance:  

### **1. Data Preprocessing:**  
- Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood, condition).  
- Normalizing or scaling numerical features to handle varying units.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
- Analyzing the relationship between features and house prices.  
- Visualizing key trends (e.g., price vs. square footage, price by location).  
- Identifying the most influential features.  

### **3. Feature Engineering:**  
- Creating new features such as **price per square foot**.  
- Analyzing interaction effects between variables (e.g., bedrooms √ó bathrooms).  
- Selecting the most relevant features to reduce model complexity.  

### **4. Model Selection:**  
- Testing multiple regression algorithms:  
  - **Linear Regression** for baseline performance.  
  - **Random Forest Regressor** for capturing non-linear relationships.  
  - **XGBoost Regressor** for handling complex patterns and outliers.  

### **5. Model Evaluation:**  
- Using performance metrics such as:  
  - **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äî Explains variance in the target variable.  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äî Average absolute error in predictions.  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ‚Äî Penalizes larger errors more heavily.  
- Cross-validation to ensure generalization on unseen data.

## üìà **Model Performance**  
| **Model**               | **R¬≤ Score**     | **MAE**          | **MSE**          |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Linear Regression**     | 0.78            | 23,500 USD       | 1.2e+6           |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | **0.85**        | **18,200 USD**   | **9.5e+5**        |
| **XGBoost Regressor**     | 0.83            | 19,000 USD       | 1.1e+6           |

‚úÖ **Random Forest Regressor** provided the best performance with **85% accuracy**, making it the most reliable model for house price prediction.
