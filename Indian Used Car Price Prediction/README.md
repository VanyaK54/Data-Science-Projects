## üìå **Project Overview**  
The **Indian Used Car Price Prediction** project leverages **data analytics** and **machine learning** to estimate the prices of pre-owned cars across major **Indian metro cities**. The used car market in India is complex, with pricing influenced by factors such as:  
- **Manufacturer and model**  
- **Car age and kilometers driven**  
- **Fuel type and transmission**  
- **Body style and color preferences**  
- **Owner history and warranty availability**  

This project aims to assist **buyers**, **sellers**, and **dealers** by providing accurate price predictions, helping stakeholders make well-informed decisions.

## üéØ **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to **predict the prices of used cars** accurately by leveraging historical data. The project intends to:  

- **Help buyers** assess the fair market value of a used car.  
- **Assist sellers** in setting competitive asking prices.  
- **Support dealers** in inventory pricing optimization.  
- **Enable investors** to identify undervalued vehicles for profitable resale.

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Workflow**  

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.  
   - Encoded categorical variables like **fuel type** and **body style**.  
   - Scaled numerical variables (e.g., **kilometers driven**).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed demand and pricing trends.  
   - Explored the impact of fuel type, color preferences, and owner history on price.  
   - Identified key features driving car resale value.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created derived features such as **car age** and **price per kilometer**.  
   - Handled multicollinearity by selecting the most influential features.  

4. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested multiple regression models, including:  
     - **Linear Regression** for baseline performance.  
     - **Decision Tree Regressor** for model interpretability.  
     - **Random Forest Regressor** for handling non-linear relationships.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated model performance using key metrics:  
     - **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äî Measures how well the model explains variance.  
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äî Average prediction error.  
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ‚Äî Penalizes larger errors more heavily.  
   - Used **cross-validation** to ensure generalization.

## üìà **Model Performance**  

| **Model**                  | **R¬≤ Score**    | **MAE**           | **MSE**            |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Linear Regression**       | 0.76           | 45,200 INR         | 2.1e+7             |
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | 0.83           | 32,100 INR         | 1.4e+7             |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | **0.88**       | **27,800 INR**     | **9.8e+6**          |

‚úÖ The **Random Forest Regressor** demonstrated the best performance with an **R¬≤ score of 0.88**, making it ideal for accurate car price predictions.
