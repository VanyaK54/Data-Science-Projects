## üéØ **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the prices of used cars. By leveraging historical data and identifying the most influential features, the project aims to:  

- **Empower buyers** to assess whether a used car is fairly priced.  
- **Enable sellers** to set competitive and realistic asking prices.  
- **Help dealers** optimize inventory pricing strategies.  
- **Assist investors** in identifying undervalued cars for profitable resale.

## üèóÔ∏è **Project Workflow**  

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and removed outliers.  
   - Normalized and scaled numerical features (e.g., **kilometers driven**).  
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., **fuel type**, **body style**).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Uncovered relationships between features and price.  
   - Analyzed demand trends, color preferences, and regional price variations.  
   - Identified top factors influencing resale value.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created derived features such as **car age** and **price per kilometer**.  
   - Removed redundant and low-impact features.  

4. **Model Development:**  
   - Tested multiple regression models including:  
     - **Linear Regression** for baseline performance.  
     - **Decision Tree Regressor** for interpretability.  
     - **Random Forest Regressor** for handling non-linear relationships.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated models using key performance metrics:  
     - **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äî Explains the variance in target predictions.  
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äî Average error magnitude.  
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ‚Äî Penalizes large errors.  
   - Cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.

## üìà **Model Performance**  

| **Model**                  | **R¬≤ Score**    | **MAE**           | **MSE**            |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Linear Regression**       | 0.76           | 45,200 INR         | 2.1e+7             |
| **Decision Tree Regressor** | 0.83           | 32,100 INR         | 1.4e+7             |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | **0.88**       | **27,800 INR**     | **9.8e+6**          |

‚úÖ **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest performance with an **R¬≤ score of 0.88**, making it the most reliable model for predicting used car prices.
