## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to **analyze and predict crime trends** in **Calgary**, leveraging the **Crime and Disorder Data** provided by the **City of Calgary's open data portal**. Covering the period from **2018 to 2024**, the dataset contains detailed monthly crime reports across various Calgary communities. By uncovering hidden patterns and building a robust **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network**, the project seeks to forecast future crime occurrences, helping inform public safety strategies and resource allocation.

## **Project Strategy**  
The project follows a structured, step-by-step approach:  

1. **Data Loading & Understanding** — Importing and exploring the dataset to comprehend its structure and key attributes.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** — Cleaning the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing it for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — Uncovering crime patterns and trends through visualizations and statistical analysis.  
4. **Neural Network Model Development** — Building an LSTM neural network tailored for time series prediction.  
5. **Model Training & Optimization** — Fine-tuning model hyperparameters to enhance performance.  
6. **Crime Prediction** — Forecasting future crime occurrences in Calgary communities.

## **Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
EDA revealed several critical insights into Calgary's crime landscape:  

### **1. Community Distribution:**  
- **Beltline** emerged as the most crime-prone community, accounting for **11.4%** of the top reported crimes, followed by **Forest Lawn (10.7%)** and **Downtown Commercial Core (10.2%)**.  
- The safest community was **13M**, representing **22.7%** of the least reported crimes, followed by **02K** and **02B** (each with **13.6%**).  

### **2. Crime Category Analysis:**  
- **Theft from Vehicle** was the most frequent crime, making up **21.7%** of all reported incidents.  
- **Theft of Vehicle (16.7%)** and **Break and Enter - Commercial (13.8%)** were also prevalent.  

### **3. Yearly Crime Trends:**  
- The highest number of crimes was reported in **2019**, followed by **2022** and **2018**.  
- **2024** data was incomplete, with only a few months available.  

### **4. Monthly Crime Patterns:**  
- Crime rates fluctuated month-to-month, indicating potential **seasonal trends**.  
- Peaks were observed in summer months, aligning with increased outdoor activities.  

### **5. Community-Specific Crimes:**  
- **Forest Lawn** had a high occurrence of **Break & Enter - Other Premises**.  
- **Marlborough** had relatively low incidences of **Commercial Robbery**.  

### **6. Shifts in Crime Categories Over Time:**  
- Year-over-year analysis revealed evolving patterns in specific crime categories, providing insights into shifting public safety concerns.

## **Neural Network Model — LSTM for Crime Prediction**  
To accurately forecast future crime occurrences, a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network was employed. LSTMs are ideal for time series data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.  

### **Model Development and Training:**  
1. **Sequence Preparation:** Transforming time series data into sequences for model input.  
2. **Train-Test Split:** Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for unbiased performance evaluation.  
3. **Model Architecture:**  
   - **50 LSTM Units** to capture temporal dependencies.  
   - **Dropout Layer** to prevent overfitting.  
   - **Dense Layer** for generating final output predictions.  
4. **Model Compilation:**  
   - **Optimizer:** Adam (adaptive learning rate)  
   - **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
5. **Training:**  
   - **100 Epochs** with validation to monitor performance and adjust parameters.

## **Model Performance:**  
- **Training Loss:** Decreased significantly over time, indicating improved predictive accuracy.  
- **Validation Loss:** Demonstrated stable performance on unseen data, validating the model’s generalizability.

## **Impact and Real-World Applications:**  
The insights and predictions generated by this project have meaningful implications for **public safety** and **crime prevention** in Calgary:  

- **Proactive Policing:**  
  - Anticipating crime hotspots and deploying resources more effectively.  
- **Policy Formulation:**  
  - Identifying high-risk areas and tailoring crime prevention policies.  
- **Community Awareness:**  
  - Empowering communities with knowledge about prevalent crime types.

## **Conclusion:**  
By combining **comprehensive data analysis** with **neural network modeling**, this project successfully uncovers valuable insights into Calgary's crime trends and offers a predictive tool for future occurrences. These findings can inform **law enforcement**, **policy makers**, and **community leaders** in developing **proactive strategies** to enhance public safety and resource allocation. Further improvements could include integrating socioeconomic factors and real-time data for even more precise crime prediction.
